# QuickDrawML

    This repo holds the final project of my class, classical problem modeling.

In this repo, I implemented three training ways(**kNN**, **SVM**, **CNN**) for `Google Quick Draw` dataset.

I only use 5000 rows of data picked from 5 class of the original dataset. They are `Apple`, `Banana`, `Blueberry`, `Pineapple`, `Strawberry`.

5000 data were seperated for 4500 training data, and 500 test data. If you wanna redo my experiment, you may need to extract data by yourself since I don't provide the original data here.

## Problem 6

`problem_6/solution.m` stands for problem 6 solution.

## Problem 7

`problem_7/solution.m` stands for problem 7 solution.

## Problem 8

`problem_8/train_cnn.py` stands for CNN training based on Keras implemented Python code.

`problem_8/train_svm.py` stands for SVM training based on sklearn implemented Python code.

`problem_8/train_knn.m` stands for kNN traning and data extracting based on Matlab implemented code.
